# instagram-auto-unfollow
Auto unfollows from your Instagram account's list of followings.

**Login, choose how many people to unfollow, choose your unfollow speed and sit back.**

Script uses InstagramAPI library, which is a nice, simple shortcut. The logging is quite annoying though.

Feel free to mess around with the sleep times when unfollowing, wether to increase or decrease is up to you.


**Exceptions include, but are not limited to: action blocks, challenge blocks.** 

These can be caused by too many unfollows, use the script in moderation and you should be good.
